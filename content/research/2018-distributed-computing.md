A key aspect of pilot-based grid operations are the GlideinWMS pilot factories.
A proper and efficient use of any central block in the grid infrastructure for
operations is inevitable, and GlideinWMS factories are no exception. The
monitoring package for the GlideinWMS factory was originally developed when the
factories were serving a couple of VOs and tens of sites. Today with the
factories serving tens of VOs and hundreds of sites around the globe an update
of the monitoring is due. Moreover with the new availability of industry open
source storage and graphing packages an opportunity remains open.This work
presents the changes made to the factory monitoring to leverage different
technologies: Elasticsearch, RabbitMQ, Grafana, and InfluxDB to provide
a centralized view of the status and work of several GlideinWMS factories
located in different continents around the globe.
