We state algorithmic composition as a program synthesis
problem that relates the qualitative properties of music with
constraints for the synthesis process. The system achieves
scalability by following a divide-and-conquer strategy, syn-
thesizing different aspects of a musical composition and then
combining them together into a complete piece. This system
was implemented using Sketch, C++ and Python to output
MIDI files of synthesized melodies. We compare our gener-
ated melodies with human compositions in a survey.
