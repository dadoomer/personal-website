Some control problems are difficult to state mathematically. What is the cost
to go for putting on a sweater? What is the reward function for doing an
*ollie* in a skateboard? If smart people work at it long enough they will
figure out how to solve these problems. But, can we get away with less?

Turns out, if you spend a while using your human judgement to choose between
two slightly different controllers you can incrementally improve the controller
to (almost) do a back-flip. Could we do even better by using the power of the
crowd?
