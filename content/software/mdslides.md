Markdown slides is a very simple script to write modern slides (meaning: slides
with videos, animations, etc.) using markdown.

The git repository is at
[gitlab.com/da_doomer/markdown-slides](https://gitlab.com/da_doomer/markdown-slides),
with installation instructions and a live demo.

The coolest part is that you do not have to destroy your `.md` files with custom
syntax: the couple of hints needed to use a markdown file to build your slides
are CommonMark compliant.
